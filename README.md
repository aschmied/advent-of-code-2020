## Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles.

## Prerequisites

Solutions are tested with Python 3.9.0 on Windows 10. There are no other dependencies.

## Running

The solutions are in "day" directories and the main programs are called "main.py." So, to run the solution for day 1, do:

```
> cd day01
> python main.py
```

## Tests

Some solutions have tests. To run the tests do e.g.:

```
> cd day04
> python -m unittest discover
```
